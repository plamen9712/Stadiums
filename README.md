This is a basic CRUD application that I have written as a university project. The concept of the application is to allow for CRUD operations to be performed on stadium objects (in simple terms, user should be able to add, read, delete and update stadiums.

Important note: Before running the CRUD application, make sure you create a database with name “stadiums” and run the provided sql script “stadiums.sql” to create the necessary tables and populate them.
